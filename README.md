# books_and_courses
A personal knowledge repo with notes from books and courses I work through. Notes focus on ideas I found interesting, missing explanations, useful extensions, and my own summaries rather than full coverage. Notes are not exhaustive. It also includes my solutions to book exercises and course assignments where applicable.
